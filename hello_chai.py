# this is a comment 

# Inner working of python
# Whenever we write code in python.The python compiler converts it into byte code these byte code gets stored in .pyc files these files are not
# visible in every cases whenever we import something than these files are visible to us 
# Python Virtual Machine(PVM):- Code loop to iterate byte code.Runtime Engine.Also known as python interpreter.Byte code is not machine code
# Mutable v/s Immutable:-
# Mutable means that can be changed while immutable means that can not be changed.
# Whenever we make any variables than in python the reference gets stored in memory not the variable name means there is a type of reference not for variable
